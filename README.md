# RLProject


For conducting experiments, use following commands:

Train (DQN) `python3 ./train_dqn.py`

Train (PPO) `python3 ./train_ppo.py`

Inference (DQN) `python3 ./inference_dqn.py`

Inference (PPO) `python3 ./inference_ppo.py`

Also you can play with default hyperparameters in config.py. For now they are chosen to be suitable for PPO training.
